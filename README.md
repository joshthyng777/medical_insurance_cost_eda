# Medical Insurance Cost Factors

This notebook is a data exploration of a dataset that has the prices of different U.S Citizens and there medical care price. <br>
I found a couple interesting things and will for sure be adding in the future. This dataset contains 7 columns that I have listed <br>
in the title of the notebook itself. The whole goal is to find the optimal condition to keep your medical insurance as cheap as possible.<br>
<br>
### Basic Questions:
1. Does smoking effect your charge price? <br>
2. Do certain regions pay more than others? <br>
3. Further findings of price correlations <br>
<br>
In the future I want to add more and check about different age gaps, there are a couple things I will be adding in the future to hopefully pin <br>
a accurate price formation.
